Real-Time Object Detection System

This project demonstrates a real-time object detection application using Python and OpenCV.  
The system captures live video from a webcam, processes each frame, and detects objects using image processing techniques.

Features
- Live webcam video processing
- Object detection using contours
- Bounding box visualization
- Real-time performance

Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

 How It Works
1. Captures video frames from the webcam
2. Converts frames to grayscale
3. Applies Gaussian blur for noise reduction
4. Uses edge detection to identify object boundaries
5. Draws bounding boxes around detected objects

 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
